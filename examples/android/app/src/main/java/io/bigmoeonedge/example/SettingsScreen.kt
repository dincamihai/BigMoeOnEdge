/**
 * Every tunable the engine exposes, grouped by what it is for. Changes apply to [current] live and
 * the caller persists them.
 *
 * Each category shows the recommended configuration first and folds the rest into an
 * [ExperimentalGroup]: the levers measured on one device, measured once, or still owed a
 * measurement. They stay in the release build because testing them on other hardware is what this
 * app is for, and a lever nobody can reach is a lever nobody can refute.
 *
 * Labels keep the flag's own vocabulary, so a setting here can be matched against the CLI, the CSV
 * preamble and the docs. Descriptions say what the knob does in one or two lines and carry no
 * measured figures: a number would need the device, the model and the day beside it to mean
 * anything, and the docs are where that fits.
